# Workday Scheduler
## Description
### In this project I made a work day scheduler that allows a user to input text into a given hour block that is persistent through refresh by leveraging local storage
### I leveraged the moment js library for time based information and formatting
### based on the time of day, a user is informed if the hours are past, present, or future
### Input validation is performed
